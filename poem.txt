Once upon a time in the Station of Brains,
Studied six students toiling away,
But they had fun learning,
Even though they cried everyday.

Oh what glory awaits ahead they would dream,
Of unicorns and VCs to their heart's content
Oh what a wonderful day to be coding,
Tis a thing of beauty, excelsior!
